# myConverter
  This project is a desktop app built in purpose of programming classes. 
It's my first contact with the Java, which made me fall in love with this language.
I know It's a far from perfection but It's foundation of my Java programming skills.

## What I have learner
  Thanks to this app I got an image of object oriented programming and there are few things I'v learned:  
  
  **:fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire:** 
  - Java History
  - Java basic library
  - Data types
  - Syntax
  - Encapsulation
  - Concurency 
  - Object Oriented Programming 
  - :metal: And more :metal:
