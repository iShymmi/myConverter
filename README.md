# myConverter

<p align="center"> <img src="../assets/assets/myConverter.gif"> </p> 

  This project is a desktop app built in purpose of programming classes. 
It's my first contact with the Java, which made me fall in love with this language.
I know It's a far from perfection but It's foundation of my Java programming skills.

## What I have learner
  Thanks to this app I got an image of object oriented programming and there are few things I'v learned:  
  
  **:fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire:** 
  - Java History
  - Java basic library
  - Data types
  - Syntax
  - Encapsulation
  - Concurency 
  - Object Oriented Programming 
  - :metal: And more :metal:

 1. Help - opens instructions tab
 2. Animated icon - looped icon in independent Thread that changes it's size and look
 3. Message bar - communication bar informing user about the action
 4. Converting input - it's a field where user inputs his value  
    - value is converting in real time  
    - user can't input characters - it's blocked  
    - entered value is validated and if it's wrong program inform us at Message bar
 5. Save to history button - When we enter value we cant press enter or click this button to save conversion
 6. History button - displays saved history
 7. Remove history button - remove all saved history
